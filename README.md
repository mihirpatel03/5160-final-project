# 5160-final-project

The program runs in the driver file main.py. From there we create a random dataset and pass it to three different kNN models, comparing their results. Basic kNN is in knn.py. The bagged kNN is in feature_subsampling.py. And the Info-Gain/Feature Selection kNN is in info_gain.py. 

The data set, number of features, number of informative features, number of features per bag, number of bags, number of features to select in info gain can all be modified in main.py.
